I was trying to think of a programming language design that would be easy/fun to implement and wouldn't seem to take that long compared to traditonal programming languages.\r\n\r\nThe programming language is an [esoteric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language), statically typed and procedural programming language.\r\n\r\n### Inspired By\r\n\r\n- LOLCODE\r\n- Visual Basic\r\n- C\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n\r\n## Repository Structure\r\n\r\n\t/cmplr\r\n\t\tThe cmplr directory stores the code for the cmplr, \r\n\t\twhich is the compiler of the yoloswag420 language\r\n\t/examples\r\n\t\tExample programs written in yoloswag420\r\n\t/license.txt\r\n\t\tThe license of all the code within the repository\r\n\r\n## Manual/Tutorials\r\nThe manual and tutorials for the language are on the [wiki].\r\n\r\n[wiki]: https://github.com/miguelishawt/yoloswag/wiki","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

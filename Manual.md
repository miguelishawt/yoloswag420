# [1 Introduction](#1)
This document is the official reference manual for the yoloswag420 programming language. It contains:

1. General structure of a yoloswag420 program
2. Syntax of the language
3. Avaliable commands of the language
4. Tips and hints

## [1.1 Disclaimer](#1.1)
yoloswag420 is currently being developed, so things may drastrically change in future versions. Please be aware of this, so the site may not have updated information at the time you are reading this. However, I will try my best to keep this page updated, if any changes/additions occur.

# 2 Source Files
This section discusses source file standards for the yoloswag420 language.

## 2.1 Standard Extension
The standard extension for the yoloswag420 language is ``*.ys``

# 3 Syntax
This section describes the syntax of the language, including how to structure a program and possbily some hints and tips.

## 3.1 Structure of a Program
This section describes the structure of a program.

A typical program written in yoloswag420 has the following structure:

	#yoloswag
	
	#420

Where the keywords ``#yoloswag`` resembles the beginning of the program and ``#420`` resembles the end of the program. Anything inbetween those two keywords describe the program itself.

## 3.2 Whitespace

The yoloswag420 program is whitespace insensitive. This means that 

## Comments
Comments are notes for the programmer to read whilst reading code 

There are only single line comments (so far). Multi-line comments may be added in the future.

### Single line comments
``<3`` starts a single line comment.

#### EXAMPLE

	<3 This is a single line comment #swag


## Multi-line comments


Multi-line comments are not currently implemented.

# Statements

A statement does not end with a semi-colon like most C-based languages, instead to end a line, you simply use

# Variables

Variables are declared by their type explicity. I may in the future add dynamic typed variables, but as for now, there is none.

The syntax for declaring a variable is as follows:

	<type> <name> [= value] plz
	
Where ``<type>`` is the type of your variable, and where ``<name>`` is the name of your variable. And where ``[= value]`` is an optional value you may assign your variable to.

## Types of Variables
As of currently, there are no way to define your own type of variables (i.e. no classes).

### txt
``txt`` resembles a string of text.

#### EXAMPLE

	txt example = "This is an example" plz

### #

``#`` represents a decimal number. It is implemented as a double floating point in C++, which is 64 bits on most systems.

#### EXAMPLE

	# example = 42.5 plz

## #if

## #match

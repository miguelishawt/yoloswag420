## About

This programming language concept was made up for my research project, in year 12. I was trying to think of a programming language design that would be easy/fun to implement and wouldn't seem to take that long compared to traditonal programming languages.

The programming language is an [esoteric](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language), statically typed and procedural programming language.

### Inspired By

- LOLCODE
- Visual Basic
- C
